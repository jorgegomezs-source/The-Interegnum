                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>
                  This article argues that communism must be understood not as a
                  theoretical ideal but as the <em>real movement</em> that
                  abolishes the present state of things (Marx &amp; Engels,
                  1845–1846). At its core is a reconceptualization of
                  <strong
                    >self-consciousness as collective organizational
                    capacity</strong
                  >—the know-how developed through material struggle under
                  capitalism, which contains within it the potential to
                  transcend capitalism itself. Analyzing contemporary conditions
                  through this framework reveals that we are living in an
                  <em>interregnum</em>—a transitional period between decaying
                  capitalist orders and emergent alternatives. The central
                  political question today is whether the capabilities developed
                  through alienation, crisis, and defensive adaptation can
                  achieve <strong>organizational take-off</strong>: the shift
                  from surviving within capitalism to building the social
                  relations that abolish it. Through case studies, scenario
                  analysis, and concrete pathways, this article provides a
                  diagnostic and strategic toolkit for transformative practice.

                <h2>I. Introduction: Communism as Real Movement</h2>
                <p>
                  Self-consciousness is collective capacity, not individual
                  lucidity. Following Marx and Engels in
                  <em>The German Ideology</em>, we understand that communism is
                  not a premeditated utopia to be established, an ideal to which
                  reality must conform, but rather
                  <strong
                    >the real movement which abolishes the present state of
                    things</strong
                  >
                  (Marx &amp; Engels, 1845–1846). The conditions of this
                  movement result from the premises now in existence: the
                  material conditions of class struggle and capitalist
                  development that simultaneously generate exploitation and the
                  means of its transcendence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Transformative social change emerges not from ideological
                  conversion but from the
                  <strong>organizational take-off</strong> of capabilities
                  developed through struggle. The interregnum—the extended
                  crisis between systemic orders (Wallerstein, 2004)—generates
                  defensive adaptations that develop technical knowledge,
                  institutional experience, and collective memory exceeding
                  their current organization. When these capabilities achieve
                  collective self-consciousness through practical coordination
                  around immediate needs, they become the foundation for
                  abolishing rather than merely reforming existing relations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The argument proceeds through five analytic moves. First, a
                  Hegelian-Marxist reconceptualization of consciousness as
                  practical achievement emerging from material conditions rather
                  than introspective awareness. Second, an analysis of
                  alienation as the objective development of capabilities that
                  transcend their alienated form. Third, a diagnosis of
                  post-Fordist domination and its distinctive contradictions.
                  Fourth, an examination of the mechanism by which developed
                  capabilities achieve organizational take-off as real movement.
                  Fifth, concrete pathways for translating the abolition of the
                  present state into practice.

                <h2>II. From Ideology to Real Movement</h2>
                <p>
                  The Cartesian tradition treats self-consciousness as
                  individual introspection, the <em>cogito</em> grounding
                  certainty in self-transparent reflection. Against this, the
                  Hegelian-Marxist tradition understands consciousness as
                  <strong>practical achievement</strong> developed through
                  recognition and labor (Hegel, 1807; Marx, 1845). Marx's
                  critique of idealism in <em>The German Ideology</em> is
                  decisive: "the production of ideas, of conceptions, of
                  consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the
                  material activity and the material intercourse of men" (Marx

                  This has profound implications for understanding
                  transformation. The question is not whether individuals have
                  achieved correct consciousness, but whether the practices in
                  which they are engaged develop capabilities that exceed their
                  current organization. Communism is not an abstract program to
                  be implemented but

                    abolishes the conditions of its own existence as a

                  >
                  (Marx, 1845). Self-consciousness, in the full sense, is
                  collective capacity—the organizational know-how that enables
                  coordinated action toward the abolition of existing social
                  relations.

                  Carlos Pérez Soto's formulation distinguishes
                  <em>consciousness as mind</em> from
                  <em>consciousness as acts</em> (Pérez Soto, 2013). Workers may
                  hold conservative views while engaging in practices that
                  develop transformative capabilities; radical beliefs may
                  coexist with practices that reproduce existing relations.
                  Unlike Althusserian models that treat ideology as
                  all-encompassing, or orthodox Leninist approaches that assume
                  correct consciousness must be brought from outside, Pérez
                  Soto's framework recognizes
                  <strong
                    >the immanent development of transformative capacity through
                    practice itself</strong
                  >. The gap between empirical consciousness and class
                  consciousness reflects the genuine contradiction between the
                  consciousness guiding action and the consciousness action
                  develops.

                <h2>III. Alienation and the Development of Abolition</h2>
                <p>
                  Alienation is an objective condition, not merely subjective
                  experience. The worker in a capitalist enterprise need not
                  feel alienated to be alienated. The organization of production
                  itself—separation from means of production, subordination to
                  managerial authority—constitutes alienation regardless of
                  subjective state (Marx, 1844). Yet this alienation develops
                  capabilities exceeding its own logic, capabilities that become
                  the material basis for abolishing the conditions that produced
                  them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The factory system that alienates workers from their product
                  develops their technical skills, coordination capacity, and
                  production knowledge. These capabilities emerge in alienated
                  form—knowledge belonging to capital, coordination serving
                  profit. But their material existence—trained workers,
                  operational facilities, proven solutions—constitutes developed
                  powers that could be organized differently.
                  <strong
                    >The premises for abolishing the present state of things are
                    generated by the present state itself</strong
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This analysis extends to social reproduction—the
                  often-invisibilized labor of care, socialization, and daily
                  maintenance that sustains life and labor power. Feminist
                  political economy (Federici, 2012; Fraser, 2016) reveals how
                  capitalism simultaneously exploits and destabilizes social
                  reproduction, generating crises of care that force communities
                  to develop alternative coordination mechanisms. These
                  <strong>crisis-generated capabilities</strong>—from mutual aid
                  networks to community kitchens—represent another dimension of
                  alienated yet potentially liberatory capacity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Revolutionary practice operates with partial, incomplete
                  consciousness of its own realities. This is not a defect to be
                  overcome but the necessary form of transformative practice.
                  The question is whether capabilities developed through
                  alienated practice can achieve organizational take-off through
                  transformation of the social relations organizing their
                  deployment. The movement does not proceed from an ideal
                  blueprint but from the practical necessity of addressing
                  conditions that have become intolerable.

                  The transformation of wartime logistics into cooperative
                  infrastructure in northern Syria illustrates how developed
                  capabilities achieve organizational take-off, even as the
                  political structures that birthed them undergo fundamental
                  transition. During the conflict against ISIS, the Autonomous
                  Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES) developed
                  decentralized supply networks to circumvent blockades and
                  coordinate military-civilian production. These networks
                  emerged not from a prior ideological blueprint but from the
                  material necessity of survival under siege.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When military necessity diminished, these capabilities did not
                  dissolve. The procedural knowledge of decentralized
                  coordination and the technical infrastructure of alternative
                  supply chains persisted as an "organizational inheritance."
                  Between 2019 and 2024, approximately 4,200 agricultural and
                  industrial cooperatives emerged, repurposing coordination
                  mechanisms once used for military logistics toward civilian
                  production.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By January 2026, the "Rojava experiment" entered a new phase
                  following a major offensive by the Syrian transitional
                  government. Under the comprehensive integration agreement of
                  January 30, 2026, DAANES institutions began folding into
                  central state bodies. While the era of de facto autonomy has
                  effectively ended, the legacy of its cooperative networks
                  faces a critical test of endurance. The agreement specifies
                  that civilian employees will retain their posts, raising the
                  possibility that the technical achievements of the cooperative
                  system may survive as specialized local administrative units
                  within the unified Syrian framework.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The transformation was never automatic. External pressures and
                  internal contradictions always limited the scope of
                  development. Yet the case demonstrates a vital mechanism:
                  capabilities developed in one context—wartime survival—become
                  resources for a different social organization when the
                  original deployment transforms. As these networks move from
                  autonomous revolutionary tools to integrated
                  state-administered cooperatives, the "real movement" continues
                  to proceed from existing material conditions rather than ideal
                  plans.

                  The digital realm represents a contemporary frontier of both
                  alienation and organizational potential. Platform capitalism
                  extracts value through data surveillance and algorithmic

                <p>
                  Post-Fordist capitalism operates through
                  <strong>repressive tolerance</strong>: the system's efficacy
                  marginalizes direct repression while tolerance itself becomes
                  the primary vehicle of subjection (Marcuse, 1965). New work
                  organizations have reduced classical components of physical
                  fatigue and psychological components of vertical, compulsive,
                  direct domination. This is exploitation without
                  oppression—exploitation that does not generate visible
                  suffering prompting resistance.

                  The frustrating agreeableness of these conditions generates
                  dissatisfaction widely observed but difficult to conceptualize
                  politically. Workers are neither the exploited proletariat of
                  classical Marxism nor satisfied consumers of bourgeois
                  ideology. They are subjects whose developed capabilities
                  exceed the social relations organizing them, but who lack
                  organizational forms for transformative deployment. The
                  material conditions for abolishing these relations develop

                  Bureaucratic hegemony increasingly displaces bourgeois

                  control through administrative rationality, technical
                  expertise, and organizational procedure (Wright, 2010). The
                  same planning capacity that could organize production for
                  social need currently organizes it for profit and control. The
                  contradiction for transformative practice is navigating
                  capabilities developed under bureaucratic capitalism toward
                  the abolition of the conditions that produced them.

                  consciousness and class consciousness bridges through
                  practical coordination around immediate needs. When climate

                  experience, and collective problem-solving capacity that could

                    violence. The criminalization of mutual aid during crises
                    (as seen in some pandemic responses) or the suppression of
                    digital sovereignty tools through anti-encryption laws
                    exemplify this strategy.

                  Effective mitigation requires institutional firewalls
                  separating emergent organizations from co-optative pressures.
                  Legal safeguards protecting cooperative autonomy, public
                  benefit corporation structures, and community land trusts
                  prevent asset stripping. Funds bypassing private
                  finance—public banking, sovereign wealth mechanisms, community
                  endowment funds—reduce dependency on financial markets.
                  Democratic governance structures with rotating leadership and
                  member control prevent bureaucratic capture.

                  Organizational take-off unfolds through material conditions
                  rather than predetermined timelines. Three scenarios
                  illustrate the range of possibility with specific indicators:

                    Transformation (5–15 year horizon)</strong
                  ><br />
                  Cascading climate disasters, financial collapse, or
                  geopolitical rupture create conditions where existing
                  institutions cannot deliver, and emergent organizations
                  demonstrate superior functionality. Political coalitions
                  crystallize around immediate needs, and international
                  solidarity provides resources.
                  <em>Indicators:</em> Municipalist networks in Southern Europe
                  (Barcelona, Naples) link with solidarity economy movements in
                  Latin America (Brazil's MST, Argentine recuperated factories),
                  creating transnational infrastructure for needs-based
                  production. Digital commons achieve critical mass, providing
                  alternative communication and coordination platforms.

                    Rupture (20–40 year horizon)</strong
                  ><br />
                  Capabilities develop through defensive adaptation, but social
                  relations transform slowly, constrained by institutional
                  inertia. Organizational take-off occurs sectorally and
                  regionally, creating archipelagos of alternative coordination
                  within persistent capitalist dominance.
                  <em>Indicators:</em> Platform cooperatives capture significant
                  market share in specific sectors (delivery, creative work).
                  Community energy projects achieve energy sovereignty in
                  particular municipalities. Public banking initiatives spread
                  across regions but face constant regulatory containment.
                  Transformation proceeds through attrition rather than
                  breakthrough.

                    Capabilities (Ongoing threat)</strong
                  ><br />
                  The organizational capacity for coordination developed through
                  crisis is channeled toward authoritarian consolidation or
                  sectarian conflict. The interregnum extends indefinitely, with
                  periodic crises generating capabilities that reactionary
                  formations capture more effectively.
                  <em>Historical precedent:</em> The organizational forms
                  developed through early 20th century labor and socialist
                  movements were partly captured by fascist and Stalinist
                  bureaucracies. <em>Contemporary risk:</em> Digital
                  surveillance capacities developed for commercial purposes are
                  repurposed for authoritarian social control. Climate
                  adaptation becomes militarized privilege rather than
                  collective right.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This scenario threatens unless proactive organizational
                  development creates viable alternatives that demonstrate both
                  efficacy and ethical superiority.

                <h2>VI. Practical Pathways: The Movement in Action</h2>
                <p>
                  The following pathways translate the real movement into
                  practice. Each emerges from existing material conditions
                  rather than ideal plans, addressing contradictions that have
                  become practically intolerable.

                    >First, pilot Global Care and Climate Corps at municipal
                    scale.</strong
                  >
                  These programs link youth employment, care services, and
                  climate adaptation through public employment frameworks. They
                  emerge from the material convergence of unemployment crises,
                  care deficits (Fraser, 2016), and climate adaptation needs.
                  Metrics include jobs created per million invested, service
                  coverage in underserved areas, and organizational learning
                  documented through operational manuals. Successful pilots
                  demonstrate the viability of needs-based coordination.
                  <em>Example:</em> The "Care Municipalism" experiments in
                  Basque country, which integrate eldercare, youth employment,
                  and sustainable agriculture through public-community
                  partnerships.

                    conversions.</strong
                  >
                  Private infrastructure, factories, data centers, and utility
                  grids facing closure or sale can convert to cooperative or
                  public trust ownership. These conversions emerge from the
                  material failure of private ownership to maintain essential
                  services. Templates address governance structures ensuring
                  democratic control, financing mechanisms reducing dependency
                  on private capital, and transitional arrangements maintaining
                  continuity. <em>Example:</em> The "Cleveland Model" of
                  worker-cooperative networks anchored by large institutions
                  like hospitals, providing stable demand and technical support.

                    procedures.</strong
                  >
                  How-to manuals from crisis operations, climate adaptation
                  projects, and cooperative formations should be collected,
                  systematized, and licensed as open public goods. These
                  repositories emerge from the recognition that knowledge
                  developed through struggle is repeatedly lost when specific
                  initiatives dissolve. Commons prevent redundant learning and
                  accelerate organizational development. <em>Example:</em> The
                  "Transition Network's" open-source toolkit for community
                  resilience projects, continuously updated through practitioner
                  input.

                    banking and sovereign funds.</strong
                  >
                  Organizations dependent on private finance face perpetual
                  pressure toward profit maximization. Public financial
                  institutions with explicit social mandates can provide patient
                  capital, reducing vulnerability to market discipline. These
                  institutions emerge from the material failure of private
                  finance to meet social needs. <em>Example:</em> The Public
                  Bank of Amsterdam, designed to fund green transitions and
                  social housing while operating democratically.

                    local initiatives—beyond NGO dependency.</strong
                  >
                  Organizational take-off in one context creates resources for
                  others: technical assistance, legal templates, financial
                  solidarity, political protection. These networks must develop
                  <strong>asymmetric reciprocity</strong> that avoids recreating
                  donor-recipient hierarchies. <em>Models:</em> The "Fearless
                  Cities" network facilitates peer-to-peer learning between
                  municipalist movements. The "International Cooperative
                  Alliance" provides solidarity funds controlled by member
                  organizations rather than external donors. Digital platforms
                  like "Commonfare" enable direct resource sharing between
                  communities without bureaucratic intermediaries.

                <h2>VII. Conclusion: The Abolition of the Present State</h2>
                <p>
                  The Hegelian-Marxist conception of self-consciousness as
                  collective know-how reframes prospects for transformation. The
                  question is not whether individuals have achieved correct
                  consciousness but whether capabilities developed through
                  struggle can be organized through social relations enabling
                  the abolition of existing conditions. Self-consciousness is
                  the achievement of capacity for self-determination—collective
                  capacity to direct social production toward human need rather
                  than profit (Marx, 1844; Hegel, 1807).
                </p>

                <p>
                  This self-consciousness develops through practice, not theory.
                  It is partial, shaped by alienation and domination that
                  characterize conditions of emergence. And it is dynamic,
                  developing through contradiction between capabilities practice
                  creates and social relations organizing them. The real
                  movement does not proceed from an ideal blueprint but from the
                  material necessity of addressing conditions that have become
                  intolerable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The interregnum intensifies this contradiction. Old orders
                  decompose; new orders cannot yet be born. In this gap, the
                  question of self-consciousness becomes decisive: whether
                  know-how developed through defensive adaptation can achieve
                  organizational take-off, whether collective capacity for
                  coordination can be directed toward the abolition of
                  capitalist constraints.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The prospects depend on specific organizational forms through
                  which developed capabilities achieve collective
                  self-consciousness and political direction. The task is
                  building organizations that develop consciousness through
                  coordination around immediate needs, demonstrating alternative
                  viability, accumulating procedural knowledge enabling
                  different social relations.

                    >Communism is not an ideal to which reality must conform but
                    the real movement which abolishes the present state of
                    things</strong
                  >
                  (Marx &amp; Engels, 1845–1846). Self-consciousness, in the
                  end, is not what precedes this movement but what emerges from
                  it: collective capacity for self-determination that
                  constitutes genuine freedom.

                    The threshold moment when capabilities developed through
                    struggle achieve sufficient coordination, scale, and
                    self-awareness to begin transforming the social relations
                    that originally produced them, moving from resistance within
                    the system to building alternatives beyond it.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Real Movement</dt>
                  <dd>
                    The practical, material process of abolishing existing
                    social relations, as opposed to theoretical or ideological
                    programs for change (Marx &amp; Engels, 1845–1846).
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Repressive Tolerance</dt>
                  <dd>
                    A form of social control where dissent is permitted and even
                    encouraged within boundaries that ultimately reinforce
                    systemic domination, creating the appearance of freedom
                    while neutralizing transformative potential (Marcuse, 1965).
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Self-Consciousness (Hegelian-Marxist)</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Collective organizational capacity and practical know-how
                    developed through material struggle, as opposed to
                    individual introspection or ideological correctness.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Social Reproduction</dt>
                  <dd>
                    The often-invisibilized labor of care, socialization, and
                    daily maintenance that sustains life and labor power,
                    constituting a crucial site of both capitalist exploitation
                    and potential resistance (Federici, 2012; Fraser, 2016).
