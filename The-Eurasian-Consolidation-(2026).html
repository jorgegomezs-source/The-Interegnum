                <p>
                  The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent Western
                  sanctions regime accelerated processes that had been
                  developing for decades: the reorientation of Russian energy
                  and commodities toward Asian markets, the construction of
                  infrastructure bypassing Western-controlled transit routes,
                  and the diplomatic alignment of states excluded from or
                  marginal to the American-led order. The "turn to the East"
                  that Russian policy documents had long advocated became
                  material necessity. The "no limits partnership" between Russia
                  and China, declared shortly before the invasion, was tested
                  and deepened by shared confrontation with Western sanctions.
                  The expansion of BRICS in 2024, incorporating Iran, Saudi
                  Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Ethiopia,
                  provided institutional framework for this reorientation,
                  however limited its operational capacity. What emerged was
                  less a planned new order than a
                  <strong>siege economy</strong>—a hastily assembled network of
                  alternative routes and mechanisms defined as much by what it
                  excludes (Western control) as by what it integrates.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The question that follows is whether this acceleration
                  constitutes qualitative transformation—the emergence of
                  Eurasian bloc capable of challenging Western hegemony—or
                  quantitative intensification of patterns that remain
                  constrained by structural obstacles. The analysis examines the
                  institutional and infrastructural architecture of attempted
                  consolidation: energy and commodity flows, financial
                  mechanisms, military cooperation, and the diplomatic
                  frameworks that coordinate without integrating. The assessment
                  is skeptical: the Eurasian powers face competitive interests
                  that preclude genuine alliance, structural dependencies that
                  Western sanctions have intensified rather than eliminated, and
                  the temporal contradiction that their cooperation attempts to
                  address—relative decline of American hegemony—generates
                  pressures that undermine their own capacity for collective
                  action.
                </p>

                <h2>
                  The Material Base: Energy, Commodities, and Infrastructure
                </h2>

                <p>
                  The foundation of Eurasian consolidation is material: the
                  hydrocarbon reserves of Russia, Iran, and Central Asia; the
                  mineral resources of Siberia and the Arctic; the agricultural
                  production of Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan; the industrial
                  capacity of China and, to lesser extent, India. The
                  complementarity is apparent: energy and raw materials flow
                  eastward, manufactured goods flow westward, with
                  infrastructure construction—pipelines, railways,
                  ports—enabling circulation that maritime Western dominance had
                  constrained.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Power of Siberia pipeline, operational since 2019,
                  delivers Russian gas to China; Power of Siberia 2, under
                  negotiation, would expand capacity and connect western
                  Siberian fields. The Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil
                  pipeline enables Russian crude export to Asia independent of
                  European transit. These projects, long delayed by pricing
                  disputes and Chinese reluctance to over-depend on single
                  supplier, were accelerated by Western sanctions that
                  eliminated European alternative. The "strategic partnership"
                  became material necessity for Russia and commercial
                  opportunity for China.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Iranian dimension adds further complexity. Sanctioned by
                  Western powers since 1979, Iran developed infrastructure and
                  trading relationships oriented toward Asia: oil sales to China
                  and India, barter arrangements, financial mechanisms bypassing
                  dollar clearing. The 25-year comprehensive cooperation
                  agreement with China, signed in 2021, provides framework for
                  expanded investment, though implementation has been slower
                  than announced. The normalization of Saudi-Iranian relations,
                  brokered by China in 2023, reduced Gulf tensions that had
                  constrained regional energy cooperation, though it did not
                  eliminate competitive dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The infrastructure of Eurasian consolidation extends beyond
                  energy to transportation and digital connectivity. The
                  International North-South Transport Corridor—envisioned since
                  2002, operationalized since 2022—connects Russia through the
                  Caucasus and Caspian to Iran and Indian Ocean ports, reducing
                  transit time and cost compared to Suez Canal routes. The
                  China-Pakistan Economic Corridor provides alternative Indian
                  Ocean access bypassing Malacca Strait chokepoint. The Northern
                  Sea Route, opened by climate change and developed by Russian
                  investment, offers shorter Europe-Asia transit that remains
                  ice-limited and militarily vulnerable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The digital infrastructure is similarly contested: Chinese
                  Huawei 5G networks in Central Asia and Russia, Russian GLONASS
                  and Chinese BeiDou navigation systems, national internet
                  infrastructures with varying degrees of Western platform
                  exclusion. The "cyber-sovereignty" that Eurasian states claim
                  involves not merely protection from Western surveillance but
                  construction of alternative networks that Chinese technology
                  dominates.

                  The Financial Architecture: De-dollarization and Its Limits
                </h2>

                <p>
                  The sanctions weaponization of dollar-based financial
                  infrastructure—SWIFT exclusion, frozen reserves, secondary
                  sanctions—generated accelerated efforts toward alternative
                  arrangements. The bilateral currency swaps between China and
                  trading partners, the Russian SPFS and Chinese CIPS messaging
                  systems, the exploration of central bank digital currencies,
                  and the commodity pricing in national currencies—all represent
                  attempts to reduce dollar dependency that Western policy has
                  intensified.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The achievements are real but limited. Bilateral trade between
                  China and Russia is substantially conducted in yuan and
                  rubles; India purchases Russian oil in rupees; Iran has long
                  experience with sanctions-evading financial mechanisms. But
                  the dollar remains dominant in global trade, in foreign
                  exchange reserves, in commodity pricing. The alternative
                  systems lack depth, liquidity, and trust; they function for
                  specific transactions but cannot replicate the dollar's
                  universal intermediation. The "de-dollarization" that BRICS
                  rhetoric proclaims is aspiration rather than achievement, and
                  the structural obstacles—network effects, institutional
                  inertia, absence of credible alternative—are formidable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The financial integration of Eurasian economies is further
                  constrained by competitive dynamics. China's financial system
                  is state-controlled and capital-account restricted; Russia's
                  has been partially liberalized and then re-constrained by
                  sanctions; India's remains domestically oriented with limited
                  convertibility. The "multipolar" financial order that is
                  envisioned would require coordination that competitive
                  nationalism prevents: shared reserve currency, integrated
                  banking supervision, common crisis response mechanisms. The
                  BRICS New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement,
                  established 2014-2016, remain marginal to global financial
                  governance, their capitalization inadequate to systemic
                  challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The temporal dimension compounds these constraints.
                  Dollar-based financial infrastructure was constructed over
                  decades, with institutional embedding that transformation
                  cannot achieve quickly. The urgency that sanctions
                  generated—immediate need for payment mechanisms, reserve
                  security, investment channels—produced workarounds rather than
                  alternatives, temporary adaptations that do not cumulate into
                  systemic replacement. The "transition" to multipolar finance,
                  if it occurs, will extend across decades that geopolitical
                  competition may not permit. Thus, the financial 'decoupling'
                  remains a patchwork of workarounds, while the more profound
                  technological decoupling—in semiconductors, AI, and advanced
                  manufacturing—proves a harder, slower frontier, exposing the
                  fundamental dependency that underpins the rhetoric of
                  autonomy.

                </h2>

                <p>
                  Beneath the material competition lies a battle of narratives.
                  The "civilizational" and "multipolar" discourse promoted by
                  Moscow and Beijing is a potent soft-power tool that resonates
                  across the Global South, weaponizing post-colonial grievances
                  to frame Western hegemony as the singular source of
                  instability. The vocabulary of "sovereignty,"
                  "non-interference," and "civilizational diversity" provides a
                  coherent ideological counter to liberal interventionism,
                  offering a principled rationale for what is often pure
                  realpolitik. Yet this ideology masks the neo-imperial nature
                  of their own economic and security projects within Eurasia
                  itself. It functions as strategic weapon: delegitimizing
                  Western pressure while legitimizing their own spheres of
                  influence, creating a diplomatic shield that makes containment
                  politically costly.

                <h2>Military Cooperation: Alignment Without Alliance</h2>

                <p>
                  The military dimension of Eurasian consolidation is
                  characterized by alignment without alliance: coordination
                  against shared adversary without integrated command, equipment
                  standardization, or mutual security guarantees. The
                  Russia-China relationship is most developed: joint exercises,
                  technology transfer, intelligence sharing, and diplomatic
                  coordination. But the "no limits partnership" explicitly
                  excludes formal alliance; Chinese officials emphasize that
                  relationship "is not targeted at any third party," maintaining
                  ambiguity that preserves flexibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The military-technical cooperation is substantial but
                  asymmetrical. Russia supplies China with advanced weapons
                  systems—S-400 air defense, Su-35 aircraft—that Chinese
                  industry subsequently reverse-engineers and replaces with
                  domestic alternatives. The Ukraine war has accelerated this
                  dynamic: Russian military equipment has proven inadequate
                  against NATO-supplied Ukrainian forces, reducing the
                  attractiveness of Russian arms exports; Chinese observation of
                  Russian operational difficulties informs its own military
                  modernization without requiring replication of Russian errors.
                  The "partnership" involves learning from Russian failure as
                  much as benefiting from Russian capability.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Iranian dimension adds further complexity. Military
                  cooperation with Russia—drone technology transfer, satellite
                  launch assistance, potential missile technology—has developed
                  since 2022, but remains constrained by Iranian strategic
                  autonomy and Russian reluctance to provide systems that might
                  provoke Israeli or American response. The "axis of resistance"
                  that Iran constructs—Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, Iraqi
                  militias—serves Iranian regional interests that do not
                  necessarily coincide with Russian or Chinese priorities. The
                  Gaza war of 2023-2024 demonstrated both coordination
                  (Iranian-supported forces pressuring Israel on multiple
                  fronts) and limitation (no direct Iranian intervention,
                  Russian and Chinese diplomatic caution).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Indian position is most ambiguous. Historical Russian arms
                  supply and strategic partnership—formalized in 1971 treaty,
                  continued despite Western pressure—coexists with Quad
                  alignment with United States, Japan, and Australia; border
                  confrontation with China that produced lethal clashes in 2020;
                  and aspiration to strategic autonomy that rejects formal
                  alliance with either bloc. Indian participation in BRICS and
                  SCO serves multiple purposes: managing Russia relationship,
                  constraining Chinese dominance, accessing alternative
                  institutions without excluding Western partnership. The
                  "multi-alignment" that Indian strategists claim is not
                  Eurasian consolidation but its complication.

                  The institutional architecture of Eurasian consolidation is
                  characterized by proliferation without integration: multiple
                  forums with overlapping membership, competing agendas, and
                  limited operational capacity. BRICS provides the most
                  prominent framework—expanded 2024 to include major energy
                  exporters and African economies—but remains essentially
                  consultative, its declarations aspirational, its mechanisms
                  underdeveloped. The New Development Bank, BRICS's most
                  concrete achievement, lends at modest scale compared to
                  Bretton Woods institutions, with governance and currency
                  arrangements that do not challenge established order.

                  The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) includes Russia,
                  China, Central Asian states, India, Pakistan, and Iran, with
                  observer and dialogue partner status for additional states.
                  Its security dimension—counter-terrorism cooperation,
                  intelligence sharing, military exercises—addresses shared
                  concerns about separatism and instability, but does not extend
                  to collective defense or integrated command. The economic
                  dimension—trade facilitation, investment promotion—remains
                  underdeveloped compared to bilateral arrangements. The SCO
                  functions primarily as forum for regional dialogue and
                  bilateral deal-making rather than as cohesive bloc.

                <p>
                  The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), Russian-led and Central
                  Asian-focused, has achieved modest trade integration but
                  remains dominated by Russian economy and constrained by
                  Chinese Belt and Road investments that bypass or compete with
                  EEU mechanisms. The "Greater Eurasian Partnership" that Russia
                  has proposed would integrate EEU with Chinese Belt and Road,
                  but implementation has been slow and Chinese investment in
                  Central Asia proceeds through bilateral channels rather than
                  multilateral frameworks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The institutional fragmentation reflects competitive interests
                  that formal integration would require resolving. China prefers
                  bilateral arrangements that maximize its leverage; Russia
                  seeks multilateral frameworks that constrain Chinese dominance
                  and preserve its own influence; India participates without
                  committing; Iran is constrained by sanctions and regional
                  isolation; Central Asian states balance multiple relationships
                  without exclusive alignment. The "multipolarity" that these
                  institutions claim to represent is less coordinated challenge
                  to Western hegemony than competitive positioning within
                  emerging order that none can dominate.

                  The Obstacles: Competitive Nationalism and Structural
                  Dependency
                </h2>

                <p>
                  The fundamental obstacle to Eurasian consolidation is
                  competitive nationalism: the pursuit of national interest that
                  cooperation would require subordinating to collective
                  framework. Russia and China are strategic partners but also
                  historical rivals, with territorial disputes resolved but not
                  forgotten, with competing influence in Central Asia, with
                  divergent interests in Arctic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean
                  regions. The "no limits partnership" explicitly maintains
                  limits: no formal alliance, no integrated military command, no
                  shared nuclear umbrella, no common market with free movement.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The economic asymmetry between China and other Eurasian powers
                  compounds competitive dynamics. Chinese economy is larger than
                  all other BRICS combined; its manufacturing capacity exceeds
                  global demand in multiple sectors; its Belt and Road
                  investments create debt dependencies that recipient states
                  resent. The "win-win" rhetoric of Chinese diplomacy masks
                  structural extraction: raw materials and energy flow to China,
                  manufactured goods flow outward, with technology transfer and
                  value-added production concentrated in China. The
                  "development" that Chinese investment enables is subordinate
                  insertion into Chinese supply chains rather than autonomous
                  industrialization.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The structural dependencies that Western sanctions intensified
                  rather than eliminated constrain Eurasian autonomy. Russian
                  military equipment depends upon Western-origin semiconductors
                  and components that sanctions restrict and covert procurement
                  cannot fully replace. Chinese advanced manufacturing depends
                  upon Taiwan Semiconductor and Dutch ASML equipment that export
                  controls constrain. Iranian economy depends upon oil export
                  that sanctions restrict and smuggling cannot fully compensate.
                  The "decoupling" that Western policy pursues is partial and
                  asymmetric; the "self-reliance" that Eurasian states claim
                  remains aspiration rather than achievement.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The temporal contradiction is decisive: the relative decline
                  of American hegemony that creates space for Eurasian
                  consolidation also generates pressures that undermine it. The
                  urgency of immediate confrontation—sanctions evasion, military
                  procurement, diplomatic coordination—takes priority over
                  long-term institution-building. The competitive dynamics that
                  American decline enables—Chinese assertion, Russian
                  desperation, Indian multi-alignment, Iranian regional
                  ambition—generate conflict that consolidation would require
                  managing. The "strategic patience" that successful
                  consolidation would require is incompatible with the crisis
                  tempo that decline generates.

                <p>
                  The Ukraine war has transformed Eurasian consolidation from
                  diplomatic possibility to material necessity for Russia, and
                  from commercial opportunity to strategic risk for China. The
                  Russian economy's conversion to war footing—state-directed
                  production, labor mobilization, import substitution—has
                  achieved surprising resilience but at cost of technological
                  regression and long-term growth sacrifice. This militarized
                  mobilization creates new, hardened facts on the ground: supply
                  chains for drones, artillery, and ammunition now snake through
                  North Korea and Iran, creating dependencies and relationships
                  that outlive specific conflicts. The "military Keynesianism"
                  that sustains employment and production is not sustainable
                  development but the core logic of the siege economy.

                <p>
                  The Chinese response has been calibrated support without full
                  commitment: expanded energy and commodity purchases, financial
                  mechanisms bypassing sanctions, diplomatic protection at
                  United Nations, but no military equipment supply that would
                  trigger secondary sanctions and jeopardize Western market
                  access. The "no limits partnership" has proven to have limits:
                  Chinese banks restrict transactions with sanctioned Russian
                  entities; Chinese technology exports comply with American
                  export controls; Chinese diplomacy maintains Western
                  relationships alongside Russian partnership.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The architecture of this siege economy relies on critical
                  intermediaries. Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have
                  become indispensable financial and logistical hubs, leveraging
                  their non-aligned status to facilitate trade, finance, and
                  technology flows that formal channels block. Their power
                  derives not from military might but from their role as the
                  <strong>pressure valves and backchannels</strong> of the
                  sanctioned economy, making them both essential and perpetually
                  vulnerable to the shifting whims of greater powers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The spillover effects extend across Eurasia. Central Asian
                  states—Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, others—have exploited Russian
                  distraction to assert autonomy, resisting integration
                  initiatives that would subordinate them to Russian-led
                  frameworks. The Caucasus—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia—has seen
                  intensified conflict and great power competition that Russian
                  hegemony had suppressed. The Middle East—Syria, Iran, Saudi
                  Arabia, Israel—has experienced realignment and conflict that
                  Russian and Chinese influence cannot stabilize. The
                  "consolidation" that Ukraine was supposed to accelerate has

                <h2>The Global South in the Interregnum: Playing the Field</h2>

                <p>
                  This competitive coordination has unlocked agency for states
                  across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Rather than
                  passive recipients of a new bipolarity, these states are
                  actively exploiting the interregnum to play powers off each
                  other—securing investment from China while buying discounted
                  oil from Russia, acquiring arms from multiple suppliers, and
                  using BRICS membership to extract concessions from Western
                  institutions. This is not a story of the Global South aligning
                  with a Eurasian bloc, but of its political elites skillfully
                  navigating the fragmentation of hegemonic power to maximize
                  their own bargaining position, often at the expense of their
                  own populations' sovereignty and development.
                </p>

                <h2>
                  Conclusion: Competitive Coordination and the Interregnum
                </h2>

                <p>
                  The Eurasian consolidation that policy discourse and some
                  analysis identifies is more accurately described as
                  competitive coordination: alignment against shared adversary
                  without integration into cohesive bloc, cooperation in
                  specific domains without collective framework, diplomatic
                  coordination without mutual commitment. The structural
                  obstacles—competitive nationalism, economic asymmetry,
                  structural dependency, temporal contradiction—are not
                  temporary but constitutive. The "multipolarity" that this
                  coordination claims to represent is less new order than
                  extended interregnum: period of American relative decline
                  without successor hegemony, of institutional fragmentation
                  without alternative construction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The question for analysis is whether this interregnum can be
                  extended indefinitely, or whether competitive pressures
                  generate confrontation that forces alignment into alliance or
                  dissolution. The Ukraine war has demonstrated both the
                  possibilities and limits of Eurasian coordination: Russian
                  resilience with Chinese support, but also Chinese restraint
                  and Russian isolation. The Taiwan scenario—potential
                  confrontation that would test China-Russia partnership more
                  severely—remains speculative but instructive: Chinese priority
                  for reunification, Russian interest in Western distraction,
                  but also risk of escalation that neither can control and that
                  would expose the limits of their partnership.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The alternative—genuine Eurasian integration with common
                  market, collective security, and shared institutions—would
                  require transformation of national interests that competitive
                  nationalism prevents. The "civilizational" framing that some
                  Russian and Chinese discourse proposes—Eurasia as alternative
                  to Atlantic West—masks national interests that such framing
                  would require subordinating. The historical
                  precedent—Soviet-Chinese alliance and its
                  dissolution—indicates the fragility of partnerships between
                  communist states with even nominal ideological solidarity; the
                  contemporary partnership lacks even this.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For the states of Eurasia, the interregnum presents
                  opportunities and risks that competitive coordination attempts
                  to navigate. For the global South, the proliferation of forums
                  and partnerships offers leverage that non-alignment previously
                  provided, but also risks of subordination to new hegemons. For
                  Western powers, the consolidation that is feared is less
                  developed than policy response assumes, but the competitive
                  coordination that exists is sufficient to complicate
                  containment strategy. The Eurasian project, therefore, is the
                  geopolitical expression of the interregnum: a fragmented,
                  reactive, and often contradictory coordination that can
                  destabilize the old order but cannot birth a stable new one.
                  It ensures the transition will be defined not by hegemonic
                  succession, but by prolonged, competitive crisis-management—a
                  permanent state of emergency masquerading as a new world
                  order.

                  dynamics of hegemonic transition, the weaponization of
                  economic infrastructure, and the construction of alternative
                  systems. His work on the "tribute economy," super imperialism,
                  and the impossibility of reform within financialized
                  structures provides essential grounding for the text's

                  coordination within interregnum rather than genuine
                  alternative order. His analysis of how declining hegemens
                  generate pressures that undermine successor coordination
                  informs the temporal contradiction thesis.
